## Slide 2: The Problem

**Headline:** Three Massive Problems, One Platform Solution

### Problem 1: Privacy Invasion
**For Consumers:**
- 67% of Koreans uncomfortable with location tracking
- Apps like Naver/Karrot require real names, phone numbers, exact addresses
- **User Quote:** _"I want local info, but why does an app need my full identity?"_

### Problem 2: SMB Digital Divide
**For Small Business Owners:**
- 78% still rely on paper flyers (Korea Chamber of Commerce, 2024)
- Digital tools too complex (POS integration) or expensive (₩500K-2M setup)
- **Merchant Quote:** _"I can't even turn on a computer. How am I supposed to compete online?"_

### Problem 3: Family Care Crisis
**For Families:**
- Korea's aging population: 20% over 65 (fastest in OECD)
- 68% worry about parents' safety, 54% can't visit weekly
- Care services cost ₩100K-300K/month (unaffordable for most)
- **User Quote:** _"I just want to know my mom is okay without spying on her."_

                        │
                   Low Privacy
```

### Why They Can't Compete:

| Competitor | Why They Can't Copy Townin |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Karrot** | Real-name model = technical debt; privacy pivot alienates 20M users |
| **Naver Map** | Generic horizontal play; no incentive for deep care vertical |
| **Insurance Aggregators** | No daily engagement; lack behavioral data |
| **Care Services** | Service-heavy (low margin); can't pivot to data platform |

**Townin Moats:**
1. ✅ **Data Network Effects:** More users → Better GraphRAG → More users
2. ✅ **Privacy Architecture:** Incumbents can't pivot (sunk cost)
3. ✅ **AI Automation IP:** Multimodal flyer AI + compliance engine

---

## Slide 8: Traction & Validation Plan

## Appendix: Q&A Preparation

### Likely Investor Questions & Answers

**Q1: "Why can't Karrot just add safety maps?"**
**A:** Technical debt. Karrot's entire architecture is built on real-name verification and exact location tracking. Pivoting to privacy-first would:
1. Require rebuilding core systems (6-12 months, $5M+ cost)
2. Alienate existing 20M users who expect current model
3. Break existing products (neighbor verification, local chat)

Plus, safety maps require government data partnerships—Townin can move faster as small player.

**Q2: "What if GraphRAG doesn't work as well as you hope?"**
**A:** We have a 2-week validation plan ($500 budget) to prove it before full build. If validation fails, pivot options:
- Rule-based recommendations (still valuable, just less sophisticated)
- Partner with existing insurtech for insurance piece
- Focus on safety + commerce only (defer insurance to Phase 4)

Core business (safety maps + flyer digitalization) doesn't depend on GraphRAG working perfectly.

**Q3: "How do you compete with free Google/Naver Maps?"**
**A:** We don't compete—we complement. Townin uses their maps as the base layer. Our differentiation:
1. **Depth:** Hyper-local safety data (CCTV, lighting) they don't have
2. **Privacy:** We don't track continuous location, just 3 hubs
3. **Care:** IoT sensors + AI interpretation (they have zero family care features)
4. **Commerce:** AI flyer automation (they only have paid listings)

Users will have both apps. Naver for navigation, Townin for living.

**Q4: "Why will merchants pay ₩50 when they can post free on Karrot?"**
**A:** Different use case:
- Karrot: Peer-to-peer classifieds (used items, services)
- Townin: Professional flyer distribution (promotions, sales)

Merchants already pay ₩5,000-20,000 for paper flyer printing/distribution. ₩50 for digital exposure is **100x cheaper**. Plus, we do the digitalization work (they just photograph).

Early adopters won't be price-sensitive—they'll pay for the magic (3-second online store).

**Q5: "What's your user acquisition cost (CAC)?"**
**A:** Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Near zero
- Safety maps are free utility (organic growth)
- Security Guard referrals (paid commission, not upfront CAC)
- PR/word-of-mouth in apartment complexes

Phase 2 (Months 7-12): ~₩5,000 ($4) per user
- Targeted Facebook/Instagram ads to families (care angle)
- Gamification rewards for "gray zone" exploration

LTV/CAC: Target 10:1 by Month 12 (LTV ≈ ₩50,000 from commerce + lead fees)

**Q6: "How do you ensure data privacy compliance?"**
**A:** Three-layer approach:
1. **Design:** No PII collection by default (grid location, hashed IDs)
2. **Legal:** Pre-launch PIPA audit ($10K budgeted)
3. **Transparency:** Open privacy policy, easy opt-out for all data types

We're also building for future regulations (GDPR-like). Privacy-first = competitive moat AND regulatory protection.

**Q7: "What's the exit strategy?"**
**A:** Three paths (timeline: 3-5 years):
1. **Acquisition by Insurance Company** (Samsung Life, KB, Hanwha) - Most likely
   - They want behavioral risk data, we become their consumer data arm
   - Valuation: $50-100M

2. **Acquisition by Platform** (Naver, Karrot, Kakao)
   - They want safety/care features without building in-house
   - Valuation: $30-80M

3. **Independent Scale** (Global expansion to Japan/Vietnam)
   - Become regional leader in hyper-local OS
   - Valuation: $200M+ (IPO potential)

Preference: #1 (strategic fit with insurance) or #3 (if traction justifies independence)
