---

## Selection Criteria

### Critical Requirements (Must Have)

- Mix of young families + seniors (multi-generational appeal)
- High proportion of two-income households (care needs for aging parents)
- Existing local commerce (small stores nearby for flyer partnerships)

---

## Priority 1: Bundang (분당구) Complexes

### Why Bundang First?
- ✅ **Affluent:** Avg household income 20% above Seoul average
- ✅ **Tech Workers:** High concentration of IT professionals (proximity to Pangyo)
- ✅ **Family-Oriented:** 65% households with children (care + safety needs)
- ✅ **Community Culture:** Strong resident engagement, active online communities
- ✅ **Less Competitive:** Lower app saturation vs Gangnam

### #1 Priority: 판교원마을5단지 (Pangyo Wonmaeul 5 Complex)

**Location:** 경기도 성남시 분당구 삼평동
**Households:** ~1,200
**Built:** 2010-2012

#### Demographic Profile:
- **Age:** 30-45 (young professionals with young kids)
- **Income Level:** High (Tier 4-5, avg property value ₩800M-1.2B)
- **Occupation:** IT/Tech (Kakao, Naver employees), Finance
- **Family Structure:** Nuclear families (2 parents + 1-2 kids) + aging parents elsewhere

#### Why This Complex is Ideal:
1. **Tech-Savvy:** Highest smartphone penetration, early adopters
2. **Sandwich Generation:** Young professionals worried about aging parents in other cities
3. **Active Community:** Strong Naver Cafe (판교원마을5단지 커뮤니티, ~2,000 members)
4. **Safety Concerns:** Near busy road (Pangyo-ro), parents worry about kids
5. **Parking Hell:** Notorious parking shortage → parking map high value

#### Engagement Strategy:
- **Security Guard Recruitment:** Target active Naver Cafe moderators (offer ₩5/ad commission + "보안관" badge)
- **Entry Point:** Offer free CCTV + street light safety map (immediate value)
- **Family Care Hook:** Subsidize 50 IoT sensor kits for early adopters with aging parents

#### Expected Penetration:
- **Month 1:** 100 households (8%) via Naver Cafe promotion
- **Month 2:** 300 households (25%) via word-of-mouth + in-complex flyers
- **Month 3:** 400+ households (33%+) via network effects

#### Risk Factors:
- ⚠️ May be too tech-savvy (already using many apps, harder to get attention)
- ⚠️ High-income = higher CAC expectations (need premium features fast)

**Mitigation:** Emphasize privacy differentiation (vs Naver/Karrot), free IoT sensors as premium perk

### #2 Alternative: 분당 서현동 푸르지오그랑블 (Seohyeon Prugio Grandboul)

**Location:** 경기도 성남시 분당구 서현동
**Households:** ~800
**Built:** 2018 (newer construction)

- **Income Level:** Very High (Tier 5, avg property value ₩1.2B-1.5B)
- **Occupation:** Executives, Medical professionals, Legal
- **Family Structure:** Dual-income, aging parents living separately or with them

#### Why This Complex:
1. **Premium Positioning:** Residents expect best-in-class services (willing to pay)
2. **Aging Parent Co-Residence:** 20% have parents living with them (high care need)
3. **New Construction:** Smart home features already (IoT integration easier)
4. **Concierge Culture:** Used to premium services (less price-sensitive)

#### Engagement Strategy:
- **Entry:** Partner with complex management (official endorsement)
- **Positioning:** "Premium safety + care service for discerning families"
- **Pricing:** Test paid IoT subscription (₩10K/month) vs free model

#### Expected Penetration:
- **Month 1:** 80 households (10%) via management introduction
- **Month 2:** 200 households (25%)
- **Month 3:** 280 households (35%)

#### Risk Factors:
- ⚠️ Smaller size (800 vs 1,200) = less network effect potential
- ⚠️ May demand more features before adopting

### #3 Fallback: 분당 정자동 주공9단지 (Jeongja Jugong 9 Complex)

**Location:** 경기도 성남시 분당구 정자동
**Households:** ~1,500

- **Income Level:** Mid-High (Tier 3-4, avg property value ₩600M-900M)
- **Occupation:** Mixed (professionals, small business owners)
- **Family Structure:** Empty nesters + some multi-generational

#### Why This Complex:
1. **Family Care Need:** Highest proportion of seniors (65+) in Bundang
2. **Community Tight-Knit:** Long-term residents, strong social bonds
3. **Less App Savvy:** Lower digital literacy = less competitive app landscape
4. **Safety Concerns:** Older infrastructure (elevator safety, lighting)

#### Engagement Strategy:
- **Entry:** Focus on family care (adult children monitoring aging parents within complex)
- **Education:** More hand-holding (app usage tutorials, in-person demos)
- **Security Guard:** Recruit respected long-term resident (trust = key)

#### Expected Penetration:
- **Month 1:** 50 households (3%) - slower adoption due to age
- **Month 2:** 150 households (10%)
- **Month 3:** 300 households (20%)

#### Risk Factors:
- ⚠️ Slower tech adoption (may need simplified UX)
- ⚠️ Lower income = less willing to pay for premium features

---

## Priority 2: Gangnam (강남구) Complexes

### Why Gangnam (If Bundang Fails)?
- ✅ **Highest Income:** Max willingness to pay
- ✅ **Insurance Market:** Best insurance product fit (high coverage needs)
- ✅ **Status Symbol:** Success here = PR value ("Gangnam's choice")
- ❌ **Most Competitive:** Every app targets Gangnam first
- ❌ **Harder Community Access:** More privacy-conscious, less community engagement

---

### #1 Priority: 대치동 은마아파트 (Daechi Eunma Apartments)

**Location:** 서울시 강남구 대치동
**Households:** ~3,000 (very large)
**Built:** 1979 (old but high-value land)

#### Demographic Profile:
- **Age:** 45-65 (wealthy empty nesters, some with high school kids)
- **Income Level:** Extremely High (Tier 5+, avg property value ₩2B-3B)
- **Occupation:** Business owners, Executives, Investors
- **Family Structure:** Multi-generational (grandparents, parents, kids in education)

#### Why This Complex:
1. **Education Focus:** Daechi = education hub, parents hyper-engaged in kids' safety
2. **Insurance Market:** Highest insurance coverage per capita in Korea
3. **Wealth:** Willing to pay premium for family care (less price-sensitive)
4. **PR Value:** "Eunma residents trust Townin" = massive credibility

#### Engagement Strategy:
- **Entry:** Target "학원 (hagwon) route safety" (kids walking to cram schools)
- **FP Partnerships:** Many residents are insurance FPs themselves (early adopter pool)
- **Premium Tier:** Offer paid features from Day 1 (₩20K/month for premium care)

#### Expected Penetration:
- **Month 1:** 150 households (5%) - conservative due to competition
- **Month 2:** 450 households (15%)
- **Month 3:** 900 households (30%)

#### Risk Factors:
- ⚠️ Too large (3,000 households hard to dominate)
- ⚠️ Very competitive (Naver, Karrot deeply entrenched)
- ⚠️ Privacy-conscious (may resist IoT sensors in home)

## Recommended Launch Strategy: Two-Complex Test

### Approach: Parallel A/B Test

**Complex A: Pangyo Wonmaeul 5 (Bundang)**
- **Profile:** Tech-savvy, young families, early adopters
- **Entry:** Free safety maps + IoT sensor subsidy
- **Hypothesis:** Fast adoption (30% in 3 months), high engagement

**Complex B: Seohyeon Prugio (Bundang)**
- **Profile:** Premium, older, concierge culture
- **Entry:** Premium positioning, partner with management
- **Hypothesis:** Slower adoption (20% in 3 months), higher willingness to pay

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** Scout both complexes, identify Security Guard candidates
- **Week 3-4:** Launch in Complex A (Pangyo Wonmaeul 5) FIRST
- **Month 2:** If A succeeds (>100 users), launch Complex B
- **Month 3:** If A fails (<50 users), pivot strategy before B launch

**Success Criteria:**
- At least ONE complex reaches 30% penetration by Month 3
- If both succeed → Replicate model to 5 more Bundang complexes (Month 4-6)
- If both fail → Re-evaluate approach (may need different value prop or city)
